## Our Current Projects

### MQF - Built by Airmen
An app to help USAF Aircrew study their Master Question File tests. Currently has data for C-17s with plans for several more MAF aircraft. Check out our FAQs here: [MQF FAQs](https://airmencoders.us/MQF). View the [Source Code ](https://github.com/airmencoders/MQF).

### Hawg Ops - Mission and Flight Planning
An app built to help mission crews generate scenarios for sorties. IPs, Patches, OSS/IN all can use this to plot out threats, friendly locations, and more to create CAS and CSAR scenarios. Future expansion includes a Weather Gonkulator.

### DSN Europe
DSN phone numbers are part of our everyday life as military members. Sometimes not having access to the right conversion outside of the office can be very frustrating. With DSN Europe* you can dial a DSN number right from your cell phone and our algorithm will make the necessary conversion to a commercial phone number**.

## Team Guidelines
* We build code to help Airmen, they are our customers not our OPRs/EPRs!
* We open source as much as possible [cio.gov](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/OSS/) [code.mil](https://code.mil)
* We are responsible users of existing open source code
* We help each other
